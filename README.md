# Summer-2017-Incomplete-Game
Unfinished game written in Java during the summer of 2017.
The master branch here is a folder named 'Eh' because I'm good with titles. This folder is actually an Eclipse (IDE) project
foler, so to actually get at the Java files would probably be a pain. Essentially I'm just mirroring my project on github 
while I work on it in the future.

Basically a weird top-down thing where you move around as square and try to kill waves of circles who shoot at you. 
WASD to move, J to attack (because I never got any direction but up to work for attacking).
The start screen is janky as heck and freezes for 5 seconds instead of displaying a 5 second timer when you hit start.

At least everything is handmade by me from scratch: architecture and all.
